# ðŸŽ² Board Game Hub â€“ Advanced Database Application

## ðŸ‘¥ About Us
We are three computer science students working on this project as part of the Advanced Databases courseracing (TI603I). This project is more than just a class assignmentâ€”it's a full-stack application that demonstrates our ability to design and implement a relational database, apply advanced SQL features, and build a functional user-facing application on top of it.
